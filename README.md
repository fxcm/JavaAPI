# JavaAPI

Java trading SDK, a wrapper SDK of FIX API, provides clients with a fully functioning programmable API into the FXCM FX trading platform. The API’s main features are streaming executable FX trading prices, the ability to open/close positions and entry orders as well as set/update/delete stops ands limits. The API Object model is based on the FIX specification for FX. It is scalable, light and robust and is compatible on any Java-compliant operating system.

## How to login:

    private void setup(IGenericMessageListener aGenericListener, boolean aPrintStatus) {
        try {
		// step 1: get an instance of IGateway from the GatewayFactory
            if (mFxcmGateway == null) {
                mFxcmGateway = GatewayFactory.createGateway();
            }
            /*
                step 2: register a generic message listener with the gateway, this
                listener in particular gets all messages that are related to the trading
                platform Quote,OrderSingle,ExecutionReport, etc...
            */
            mFxcmGateway.registerGenericMessageListener(aGenericListener);
            mStatusListener = new DefaultStatusListener(aPrintStatus);
            mFxcmGateway.registerStatusMessageListener(mStatusListener);
            if (!mFxcmGateway.isConnected()) {
                System.out.println("client: login");
                FXCMLoginProperties properties = new FXCMLoginProperties(mUsername, mPassword, mStation, mServer, mConfigFile);
                /*
                    step 3: call login on the gateway, this method takes an instance of FXCMLoginProperties
                    which takes 4 parameters: username,password,terminal and server or path to a Hosts.xml
                    file which it uses for resolving servers. As soon as the login  method executes your listeners begin
                    receiving asynch messages from the FXCM servers.
                */
                mFxcmGateway.login(properties);
            }
            //after login you must retrieve your trading session status and get accounts to receive messages
            mFxcmGateway.requestTradingSessionStatus();
            mAccountMassID = mFxcmGateway.requestAccounts();
        } catch (Exception e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }

## How to get the rollover:

With Java API you can get the current rollover for each symbol, it can be done with the functions getFXCMSymInterestBuy()and getFXCMSymInterestSell() from TradingSecurity Class,  for Long and Short positions.

	For example:
	getFXCMSymInterestBuy() = 0.12     you will get $0.12 for 10k
	getFXCMSymInterestSell() = -0.39    you will pay $0.39  for 10k

	the 10k in this example is the server default base unit size, it can be found with FXCMParamValue where FXCMParamName = “BASE_UNIT_SIZE”
